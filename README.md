## 📍 Introduction

### Project Introduction
**TrailerCabin** is a product design project developed using CATIA V5.

This project explores a scaled-down trailer cabin concept inspired by automotive body structures. The exterior panels were created using surface-based modeling workflows, including the design of flanges and joggle surfaces for part connections. Structural beads were applied to enhance panel stiffness, while inner panels were designed with draft analysis and undercut considerations to ensure manufacturability.

For interior components, doghouse and rib structures were implemented to improve rigidity and support screw and grommet fastening. Additional rib structures were designed between the outer and inner panels, and selected parts were validated through 3D printing. Impact simulations were performed in CATIA to compare structural performance before and after bead reinforcement.

Throughout the process, continuous DPA was conducted to prevent interferences using notching, relief cut, and fillet matching. The project concludes with a structured BOM, family tree, and technical drawings to define the final assembly hierarchy.
